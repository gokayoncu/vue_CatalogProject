        <h2>I designed an e-commerce page with Vue in this project.</h2>
        <span class="text">
            In my single-page application, I used <strong>Router</strong> for page navigation, <strong>Supabase</strong> for the database, <strong>Pinia</strong> for state management, and <strong>Ant Design</strong> for styling. In my project, you can browse through catalogs, add products to your cart, and view product details to place orders.
